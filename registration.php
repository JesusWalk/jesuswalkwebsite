			<h1>Registration is now open!</h1>

			<p>

				JesusWalk registration is available online. If you're new to our youth conference, we're sure you may 

				have questions. Below, we've provided helpful information to guide you through the process. 

			</p>







			<h2>JW COST</h2>

			<p>

			In the current economy, we know money is tight. Thatâ€™s why we do everything we can to make the 



			JesusWalk experience the most affordable for all our students. 



			We understand it's hard to take your youth group to a youth conference. Especially if you're a small 



			church and having difficulties finding a budget for attending. We've always said don't let money be the 



			reason why you can't attend JesusWalk. Which is why we've worked hard to keep costs down, but also to 



			provide your youth group with the most impactful program to serve you, and further God's Kingdom!

			</p>



			<div class="highLightInfo">

			<h2>2016 STUDENT COST</h2>

			<p>

			The student cost for JesusWalk covers admission for 4 days; three nights lodging, breakfast, lunch and 



			dinner for all 4 days. Also included is the welcome pack with all the materials needed for the conference.



			<ul>



				<li> <strong>$185* = Individual cost</strong></li>

			<p>A full refund is only considered if a student has to miss JesusWalk for one of the following reasons: extreme medical emergency, jury duty, military call to duty, or a death in the immediate family, defined as parents, siblings and grandparents.  Reasons beyond these unfortunately will not qualify for refund consideration. A request for consideration of a refund of monies paid must be submitted by July 6, 2016, (two weeks prior to the conference start date.) 
			Refunds are not guaranteed and will be left up to the discretion of the JesusWalk Finance Committee.

			<br/><br/> Refunds are no longer transferable to other JesusWalk registrants.
