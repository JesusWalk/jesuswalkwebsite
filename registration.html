			<h1>Registration is now open!</h1>
			<p>
				JesusWalk registration is available online. If you're new to our youth conference, we're sure you may 
				have questions. Below, we've provided helpful information to guide you through the process. 
			</p>



			<h2>JW COST</h2>
			<p>
			In the current economy, we know money is tight. Thatâ€™s why we do everything we can to make the 

			JesusWalk experience the most affordable for all our students. 

			We understand it's hard to take your youth group to a youth conference. Especially if you're a small 

			church and having difficulties finding a budget for attending. We've always said don't let money be the 

			reason why you can't attend JesusWalk. Which is why we've worked hard to keep costs down, but also to 

			provide your youth group with the most impactful program to serve you, and further God's Kingdom!
			</p>

			<div class="highLightInfo">
			<h2>2016 STUDENT COST</h2>
			<p>
			The student cost for JesusWalk covers admission for 4 days; three nights lodging, breakfast, lunch and 

			dinner for all 4 days. Also included is the welcome back with all the materials needed for the conference.

			<ul>

				<li> <strong>$185* = Individual cost</strong></li>

				<li> <strong>$180* = For groups of 5 or more</strong></li>

			</ul>

			<h2>FOR PARENTS</h2>

We want to show the youth how to live in this world, but not to be of it.
