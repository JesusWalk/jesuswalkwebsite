				In the current economy, we know money is tight. That’s why we do everything we can to make the JesusWalk experience the most affordable for all our students. <br /><br /> We understand it's 
				hard to take your youth group to a youth conference. Especially if you're a small church and having difficulties finding a budget for attending. We've always said don't let money be the reason why you
				can't attend JesusWalk. Which is why we've worked hard to keep costs down, but also to provide your youth group with the most impactful program to serve you, and further God's Kingdom!
