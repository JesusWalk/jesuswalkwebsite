				Thank you for your interest in getting more involved with JesusWalk Youth Conference! We truly appreciate your willingness to help bring amazing things to our students in 2015! See below how you can be more involved with JesusWalk 2015: 
			</p>



			<h2>As a Volunteer</h2>
			<p>
			There's so much that goes on during the week of JesusWalk, which requires a lot of man power to put it all together. In order to make JesusWalk possible, we need volunteers who are willing to serve throughout the entire conference in various roles. You may apply to volunteer if you are over the age of 18. Below is a form for you to fill out along with a listing of areas JesusWalk will be needing volunteers.

			<h2>As a Counselor</h2>
			<p>
			In the current economy, we know money is tight. Thatâ€™s why we do everything we can to make the 

			JesusWalk experience the most affordable for all our students. 

			We understand it's hard to take your youth group to a youth conference. Especially if you're a small 

			church and having difficulties finding a budget for attending. We've always said don't let money be the 

			reason why you can't attend JesusWalk. Which is why we've worked hard to keep costs down, but also to 

			provide your youth group with the most impactful program to serve you, and further God's Kingdom!
			</p>
