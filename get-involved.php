			Thank you for your interest in getting more involved with JesusWalk Youth Conference! We truly appreciate your willingness to help bring amazing things to our students in 2016! See below how you can be more involved with JesusWalk 2016:
		</p>



		<h2>Volunteer Team</h2>
		<p>
			There's so much that goes on during the week of JesusWalk, which requires a lot of support to put it all together. In order to make JesusWalk possible, we need volunteers who are willing to serve throughout the entire conference in various roles. You may apply to volunteer if you are over the age of 18. Below is a listing of volunteer descriptions along with a volunteer application for you to fill out.

		<h2>Counselor</h2>
		<p>
			Whether it is by taking silly snaps or receiving spiritual guidance, a counselor is a huge part of our conference and what also makes a student’s experience memorable. Plus, who wouldn’t want to spend their summer serving AND having fun?! We are in need for willing individuals to serve alongside us and be an extension of JesusWalk is to our students. You may fill out our interest form below if you fit what we are looking for (please see below). For any other questions or concerns, you may email us at counselorservices@jesuswalkyouth.com.
